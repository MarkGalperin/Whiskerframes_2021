OCTOBER 2021: ONLY DATASETS 14-16 ARE BEING USED. ALL OTHER PREVIOUSLY-PROCESSED DATA ARE HERE, AND ARE LIKELY OUTDATED. 
No data has been deleted! This is filtered pre-processed data that is generated from the main store of data in /data/janelia. The data missing in /data/processed/janelia and then /data/processed/filtered can always be re-generated.
